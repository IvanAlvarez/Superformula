# Superformula
Generates 3D superellipses and visualises them in MATLAB.

### Installation
Add the scripts in this repository to your MATLAB path. 

### How to
To generate a single superformula solid with specific parameters, use  
s = Superformula(m, n, a, grain)  
  
To visualise it, use  
SuperformulaDisplay(s);
  
To generate a randomised family of superformula solids, use  
s = SuperformulaRandomize(Num, M, N, A, Grain);
